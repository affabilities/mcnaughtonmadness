            <h2>Bracket Scoring</h2>
            <p>Have you ever considered picking a 16 seed to beat a 1 in your bracket? Probably not. Before the start of the tournament in 
                <%= new Date().getFullYear() %> the 1 seeds were <%=132 + 4*(new Date().getFullYear()-2018) %>-0 against the 16 seeds.  
                It doesn't matter who the teams are, you quickly take the slam dunk and spend your time on the rest of the bracket. The limited foresight suggests
                this game should be worth as little as possible.</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand, the true puzzlers are typically the 8/9 matchups. Correctly picking these winners is significantly more challenging
                than the first. As a result, it should be worth more.</p>
            
            <p>But the truth is that picking an upset is harder still. The 9 seed over the 8, not so much. But the 12 seed over the 5? If you're right, 
            you deserve something more for your chutzpah. The McNaughton Madness scoring system attempts to fairly reward your prognostication.
            </p>
  
            <p>The seeding of the teams gives us a nice way to rank every possible matchup by theoretical difficulty.</p>
            
            <h3>General Scoring Rules:</h3>
            <p>If team A represents the higher seed (ex. a 5 seed) and team B represents the lower seed (ex. 12):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If team A is selected and wins: Receive the fraction A/B points</li>
                <li>If team A is selected and loses: Lose the fraction A/B points</li>
                <li>If team B is selected and wins: Receive the fraction B/A points</li>
                <li>If team B is selected and loses: Lose 1 point</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these results are then multiplied by the round (ex. round 3 triples the values of each game's gains/losses.)</p>
